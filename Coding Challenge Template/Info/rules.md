## Goal
You will be given a small web application (HTML/CSS/JS) with an intentional bug.  
Your objective is to figure out why the bug occurs and fix it!

## Making Changes
- You can modify the code however you see fit.  
- If you break something else accidentally, that’s okay—just keep us informed of your process.

## Time Frame
You have 25 minutes to work on identifying and resolving the issue.  
You will be given a heads up at the 10 and 5 minute mark.

## Allowed Resources
You can use any online or local resource you would normally use in a real development environment.  
Literally **ANYTHING**!

## Think Aloud
As you work, please walk us through your thought process. Keep us in the loop about the following:
- What do you think might be causing the bug?  
- What steps are you taking to narrow it down?  
- Why are you trying a certain approach or searching for particular keywords?

## Asking Questions
If something in the setup or functionality is unclear, feel free to ask clarifying questions.  
The aim is for you to demonstrate your debugging and problem-solving skills, not to trick you with missing information.

## Purpose
Please keep in mind, we are less concerned about how quickly you resolve the bug and more interested in **how** you resolve it.
